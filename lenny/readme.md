QRNG Impact on Security and Cracking
Security Benefits
True Randomness: QRNGs exploit quantum uncertainty (e.g., photon phase), providing randomness that’s fundamentally unpredictable, even with infinite computational power or quantum computers. This surpasses secrets, which, while cryptographically secure, relies on OS entropy pools that could theoretically be influenced.

No Seed: Like secrets, there’s no seed to brute-force, but QRNGs eliminate any deterministic underpinnings, making reverse-engineering impossible.

Future-Proofing: Resilient against quantum attacks (e.g., Shor’s algorithm), unlike some classical PRNGs.

Cracking Implications
Seed-Based Cracking: Completely obsolete, as there’s no seed or state to reconstruct.

Brute-Force: The only option remains exhaustive search of the password space (e.g., 94^12 for a 12-character password). With QRNG, each character is equally likely, maximizing entropy:
Search space: 94^12 ≈ 4.75 × 10^23.

100,000 attempts (as in the script) is negligible (~0.00000000002% of the space).

Quantum Computing: Even with a quantum computer, Grover’s algorithm only provides a quadratic speedup (reducing 94^12 to √(94^12) ≈ 6.9 × 10^11 attempts), still impractical for reasonable lengths.

Example Entropy Calculation
12 characters, all categories: 94 possible characters per position.

Entropy: log₂(94^12) ≈ 79 bits (with QRNG, fully realized due to true randomness).

Comparison: NIST recommends 80 bits for high-security passwords—QRNG meets this with a 12-character password.

Example Usage

Quantum-Inspired Password Generator and Cracker
==============================================

Generating a password with simulated quantum randomness...
Enter password length (minimum 8, press Enter for 12): 12
Include uppercase letters? (yes/no, default yes): yes
Include numbers? (yes/no, default yes): yes
Include symbols? (yes/no, default yes): yes
Enter hash algorithm (md5, sha1, sha256, default sha256): sha256

Generated password (for demo): X#7kNp&Mj4Lq
Hashed password (sha256): 9a8c3d2e... (example hash)

Now attempting to crack the hashed password...
Enter number of brute-force attempts (default 100000): 100000
Attempting to crack hashed password with 100000 brute-force attempts...
Using 4 CPU cores...

Failed to crack password after 100000 attempts.
Note: Quantum randomness ensures true unpredictability, making seed-based cracking impossible.

Password Strength Tips:
- Simulated quantum randomness (via secrets) ensures high entropy; true QRNG would be even more secure.
