Key Improvements
1. Multiprocessing
Implementation: Uses Python’s multiprocessing.Pool to distribute seed testing across multiple CPU cores (cpu_count() determines the number of processes).

Worker Function: crack_worker generates a password for a given seed and compares its hash to the target hash, returning the seed and password if matched.

Speedup: By parallelizing the search, the script leverages all available CPU cores, reducing the time to test large seed ranges (e.g., 3,600 seeds in 1 hour) significantly. For example, on a 4-core CPU, it’s roughly 4x faster than sequential execution.

2. Password Hashing Techniques
Supported Algorithms: Added support for MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 (default) via hash_password function using hashlib.

Realism: Instead of comparing plaintext passwords, the script now works with hashed passwords, mimicking real-world systems where passwords are stored as hashes.

Flexibility: Users can specify the hash algorithm during generation and cracking, ensuring consistency.

3. Code Structure
Modularity: Separated hashing and cracking logic into distinct functions for clarity and reusability.

Input Handling: Added get_hash_algorithm to validate and select the hashing method.

How It Works
Password Generation:
Generates a password using the original logic, then hashes it with the chosen algorithm (e.g., SHA-256).

Displays both the plaintext (for demo) and the hash.

Cracking Process:
Takes the target hash and brute-forces seeds in parallel across multiple CPU cores.

Each worker process generates a password for its assigned seed, hashes it, and checks for a match.

If a match is found, it returns the seed and cracked password; otherwise, it continues until all seeds are tested.

Output:
Reports progress and success/failure, including the seed, timestamp, and cracked password if successful.

'Password Generator and Cracker with Hashing'
===========================================

'Generating a password to crack...'
'Enter password length (minimum 8, press Enter for 12): 12'
'Include uppercase letters? (yes/no, default yes): yes'
'Include numbers? (yes/no, default yes): yes'
'Include symbols? (yes/no, default yes): yes'
'Enter hash algorithm (md5, sha1, sha256, default sha256): sha256'

'Generated password (for demo): P#k9mNx&L2jQ'
'Hashed password (sha256): 7f8b1a2c... (example hash)'

'Now attempting to crack the hashed password...'
'Enter time range in seconds to search (default 3600): 3600'
'Attempting to crack hashed password in 3600 second range...'
'Searching 3600 seeds from 1711315800 to 1711319400 using 4 CPU cores...'

'Success! Password cracked: P#k9mNx&L2jQ'
'Seed used: 1711319234 (Timestamp: Mon Mar 24 20:07:14 2025)'
'Hashed value: 7f8b1a2c...'
