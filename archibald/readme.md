Key Changes
1. Cryptographic Randomness with secrets
Replacement: Replaced random.choice and random.shuffle with secrets.choice and secrets.SystemRandom().shuffle.

Impact: The secrets module uses the OS’s cryptographic RNG, ensuring true randomness without a predictable seed. This eliminates the time-based seed vulnerability exploited in earlier versions.

2. Cracking Adaptation
No Seed Brute-Forcing: Since there’s no seed to guess, the cracking function now uses a pure brute-force approach, generating random passwords and checking their hashes.

Multiprocessing: Still leverages cpu_count() cores to parallelize attempts, but each worker generates a new random password instead of using a seed.

Attempts-Based: Users specify a number of attempts (default 100,000), as time-range cracking is irrelevant with cryptographic randomness.

3. Security Implications
Cracking Difficulty: With secrets, the search space is the full character set raised to the power of the length (e.g., 94^12 for a 12-character password with all categories), making brute-force impractical. For example:
94 possible characters (lowercase, uppercase, digits, symbols).

94^12 ≈ 4.75 × 10^23 possibilities.

Even at 1 million attempts per second, it would take ~15 million years to exhaust.

Hashing: The use of hashes (e.g., SHA-256) adds another layer, but the focus here is on the randomness source.

Secure Password Generator and Cracker
=====================================

Generating a cryptographically secure password...
Enter password length (minimum 8, press Enter for 12): 12
Include uppercase letters? (yes/no, default yes): yes
Include numbers? (yes/no, default yes): yes
Include symbols? (yes/no, default yes): yes
Enter hash algorithm (md5, sha1, sha256, default sha256): sha256

Generated password (for demo): K#9mPx&nL2jQ
Hashed password (sha256): 8f7b2c1d... (example hash)

Now attempting to crack the hashed password...
Enter number of brute-force attempts (default 100000): 100000
Attempting to crack hashed password with 100000 brute-force attempts...
Using 4 CPU cores...

Failed to crack password after 100000 attempts.
Note: With cryptographic randomness, seed-based cracking is impossible.

Password Strength Tips:
- This password uses cryptographic randomness, making it highly secure against seed-based attacks.

Why Cracking Fails
No Seed: Unlike random, secrets doesn’t use a seed that can be brute-forced. Each generation is independent and unpredictable.

Search Space: Even with multiprocessing, 100,000 attempts is a tiny fraction of 94^12 possibilities. 
Success is statistically improbable without a targeted approach (e.g., dictionary attack, which this script doesn’t implement).

Further Enhancements
Dictionary Attack: Add a wordlist-based approach for common passwords, as pure brute-force is inefficient.

Salt Handling: Extend hash_password to support salted hashes (e.g., with hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac) for more realistic scenarios.

Performance Tuning: Adjust the number of processes or chunk size in Pool for optimal CPU usage.

This version demonstrates the power of cryptographic randomness in securing passwords, rendering seed-based cracking obsolete.
